Apple pie word guessing game

This is a simple word guessing game in which the user has to guess a word by choosing the letters.
The player has only 7 tries for chossing letters, whenever an incorrect letter is chosen one try is subtracted.
Whenever a correct letter is chosen, the word updates to show all the correctly chosen letters of the word, on the correct possition.
When the player runs out of tries, or when the correct word is guessed, the game restarts.
